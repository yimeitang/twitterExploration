###  First, download 1M tweets and inser their values into three SQLite tables: Geo, User and Tweets
    (1)It takes much longer time if you just directly access the file online than reading from a local saved file.
    (2)So, you should first store the tweets as a local text file before reading the populating the SQLite tables.

###  Second, retrieve business insights or anything you are interesting from the SQLite tables by any SQL queries.

###  Third, store the results as csv or text file.

###  Last, use Tableau to generate colorful and effective data visualizations for your project!
